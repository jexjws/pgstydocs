Pigsty has built-in support for [Docker](/docker) and a series software that use PostgreSQL as primary storage.

You can run stateless application with docker compose, and store the data in the external HA PostgreSQL (Redis/MinIO/...) clusters.

There's a dedicate playbook [`app.yml`](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/blob/main/app.yml) that can help your running docker compose app easily
