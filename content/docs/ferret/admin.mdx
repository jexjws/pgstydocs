## Create FerretDB Cluster

After [defining](/ferret/config/) the FerretDB cluster in the [inventory](/docs/config/inventory), you can install it with:

```bash
./mongo.yml -l ferret   # Install MongoDB/FerretDB on ferret group
```

Since FerretDB uses PostgreSQL as its underlying storage, running this playbook multiple times is generally safe.

------

## Remove FerretDB Cluster

To remove a Mongo/FerretDB cluster, run the `mongo_purge` subtask of [`mongo.yml`](/ferret/playbook) playbook with the `mongo_purge` parameter:

```bash
./mongo.yml -e mongo_purge=true -t mongo_purge
```
