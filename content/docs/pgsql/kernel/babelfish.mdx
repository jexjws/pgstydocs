Pigsty allows users to create a Microsoft SQL Server compatible PostgreSQL cluster using Babelfish and WiltonDB!

- [Babelfish](https://babelfishpg.org/): An open-source MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) compatibility extension Open Sourced by AWS
- [WiltonDB](https://github.com/wiltondb/wiltondb): A PostgreSQL kernel distribution focusing on integrating Babelfish

Babelfish is a PostgreSQL extension, but it works on a slightly modified PostgreSQL kernel Fork, WiltonDB provides compiled kernel binaries and extension binary packages on EL/Ubuntu systems.

Pigsty can replace the native PostgreSQL kernel with WiltonDB, providing an out-of-the-box MSSQL compatible cluster along with all the supported by common PostgreSQL clusters, such as HA, PITR, IaC, monitoring, etc.

WiltonDB is very similar to PostgreSQL 15, but it can not use vanilla PostgreSQL extensions directly. WiltonDB has several re-compiled extensions such as `system_stats`, `pg_hint_plan` and `tds_fdw`.

The cluster will listen on the default PostgreSQL port and the default MSSQL `1433` port, providing MSSQL services via the TDS WireProtocol on this port. You can connect to the MSSQL service provided by Pigsty using any MSSQL client, such as SQL Server Management Studio, or using the `sqlcmd` command-line tool.


------

## Get Started

[**install**](/install/start) Pigsty’s with the [`mssql`](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/blob/main/conf/mssql.yml) config template.

```bash
./configure -c mssql     # Use mssql (babelfish) template
./install.yml            # install everything with pigsty
```

For production deployments, make sure to modify the password parameters in the `pigsty.yml` config before running the `install` playbook.



------

## Notes

When installing and deploying the MSSQL module, please pay special attention to the following points:

- WiltonDB is available on EL (7/8/9) and Ubuntu (20.04/22.04) but **not available on Debian systems**.
- WiltonDB is currently compiled based on PostgreSQL 15, so you need to specify `pg_version: 15`.
- On EL systems, the `wiltondb` binary is installed by default in the `/usr/bin/` directory, while on Ubuntu systems, it is installed in the `/usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/` directory, which is different from the official PostgreSQL binary location.
- In WiltonDB compatibility mode, the HBA password authentication rule needs to use `md5` instead of `scram-sha-256`. Therefore, you need to override Pigsty’s default HBA rule set and insert the `md5` authentication rule required by SQL Server before the `dbrole_readonly` wildcard authentication rule.
- WiltonDB can only be enabled for a primary database, and you should designate a user as the Babelfish superuser, allowing Babelfish to create databases and users. The default is `mssql` and `dbuser_myssql`. If you change this, you should also modify the user in `files/mssql.sql`.
- The WiltonDB TDS cable protocol compatibility plugin `babelfishpg_tds` needs to be enabled in `shared_preload_libraries`.
- After enabling the WiltonDB extension, it listens on the default MSSQL port `1433`. You can override Pigsty’s default service definitions to redirect the `primary` and `replica` services to port `1433` instead of the `5432` / `6432`ports.

The following parameters need to be configured for the MSSQL database cluster:

```yaml
pg-meta:
  hosts:
    10.10.10.10: { pg_seq: 1, pg_role: primary }
  vars:

```

You can define business databases & users in the `pg_databases` and `pg_users` section:

```yaml
#----------------------------------#

#----------------------------------#
# this is an example single-node postgres cluster with postgis & timescaledb installed, with one biz database & two biz users
pg-meta:
  hosts:

  vars:
    pg_cluster: pg-test
    pg_users:                           # create MSSQL superuser
      - {name: dbuser_mssql ,password: DBUser.MSSQL ,superuser: true, pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin], comment: superuser & owner for babelfish  }
    pg_primary_db: mssql                # use `mssql` as the primary sql server database
    pg_databases:

## Client Access

You can use any SQL Server compatible client tool to access this database cluster.

Microsoft provides [sqlcmd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-use-utility?view=sql-server-ver16) as the official command-line tool.

Besides, they have a go version cli tool: [go-sqlcmd](https://github.com/microsoft/go-sqlcmd)

Install `go-sqlcmd`:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/microsoft/go-sqlcmd/releases/download/v1.4.0/sqlcmd-v1.4.0-linux-amd64.tar.bz2
tar xjvf sqlcmd-v1.4.0-linux-amd64.tar.bz2
sudo mv sqlcmd* /usr/bin/
```

Get started with `go-sqlcmd`

```bash
$ sqlcmd -S 10.10.10.10,1433 -U dbuser_mssql -P DBUser.MSSQL
1> select @@version
2> go
version
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Babelfish for PostgreSQL with SQL Server Compatibility - 12.0.2000.8
Oct 22 2023 17:48:32
Copyright (c) Amazon Web Services
PostgreSQL 15.4 (EL 1:15.4.wiltondb3.3_2-2.el8) on x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu (Babelfish 3.3.0)

(1 row affected)
```

You can route [service](/pgsql/service/) traffic to MSSQL 1433 port instead of 5433/5434:

```bash
# route 5433 on all members to 1433 on primary
sqlcmd -S 10.10.10.11,5433 -U dbuser_mssql -P DBUser.MSSQL

# route 5434 on all members to 1433 on replicas
sqlcmd -S 10.10.10.11,5434 -U dbuser_mssql -P DBUser.MSSQL
```

------

## Install

If you have the Internet access, you can add the WiltonDB repository to the node and install it as a node package directly:

```yaml
node_repo_modules: local,node,pgsql,mssql
node_packages: [ wiltondb ]
```

Install wiltondb with the following command:

```bash
./node.yml -t node_repo,node_pkg
```

It’s OK to install vanilla PostgreSQL and WiltonDB on the same node, but you can only run one of them at a time, and this is not recommended for production environments.

------

## Extensions

Most of the **PGSQL** module’s [**extensions**](/ext/list/) (non-SQL class) cannot be used directly on the WiltonDB core of the MSSQL module and need to be recompiled.

WiltonDB currently comes with the following extension plugins:
