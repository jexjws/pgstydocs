Pigsty runs on bare [Linux](/prepare/linux), We support mainstream Linux distributions like EL / Debian / Ubuntu, and compatible Linux distributions like Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, etc...

We do this on purpose. It is hard to compile and package all the postgres related packages and hundreds of extensions into RPM/DEB for each Major version x PG version x OS Arch...

But I believe this is the right thing to do. So we don't take shortcuts like Docker, Podman, or Kubernetes.
