## FAQ

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Accordions type="single" orientation={"horizontal"}>
    <Accordion title="What is Pigsty—and what isn't it?">
        Pigsty is a PostgreSQL distribution: an open-source, local-first RDS-like solution. It isn't a database (DBMS), but rather a management tool, solution, and set of best practices. Think of a database as a car, a DBA as the driver, RDS as a taxi service, and Pigsty as self-driving software.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="What problem does Pigsty solve?">
        Database expertise is scarce and costly—you either hire expensive DBAs or pay a premium for cloud RDS. Now there's a new option: Pigsty (the "self-driving" equivalent). It lets you run databases without a dedicated DBA at under one-tenth the cost of typical RDS, while achieving greater performance and flexibility in a local cloud environment.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Why can Pigsty help you manage databases effectively?">
        Pigsty packages hard-earned best practices from large, complex PostgreSQL deployments into a reproducible solution. It tackles everything: scalable installs, high availability, connection pooling, monitoring, backup/recovery, parameter tuning, IaC-based cluster management, one-click deployment, and automated ops—letting you avoid common pitfalls and reinventing the wheel.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Why is Pigsty better than RDS?">
        Pigsty provides a richer feature set than most RDS offerings: 400+ extensions, support for 9+ Postgres kernels, a unique monitoring system, and proven architecture refined by top-tier enterprise use (Apple, Alibaba, Tantan). It's easy to use, deeply tested, and fueled by genuine passion—at a depth and maturity level typical RDS platforms can't match.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Why is Pigsty more cost-effective than RDS?">
        With Pigsty, you can run what's effectively a ¥400–¥1400/core/month RDS instance on bare-metal resources costing as little as ¥10/core/month—and skip paying a DBA's salary. At scale, total cost of ownership can drop by 90% or more. Pigsty slashes license, service, and personnel costs, so you can channel your budget where it really matters.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How does Pigsty help developers?">
        Pigsty integrates 400+ PG extensions for an all-in-Postgres approach—letting you replace Redis, Kafka, MySQL, Elasticsearch, vector databases, and even certain OLAP/big-data use cases with one stack. This boosts developer agility, cuts complexity, and enables self-serve DevOps without needing a dedicated DBA.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How does Pigsty help operations teams?">
        Pigsty's self-healing HA ensures you don't need to scramble when hardware fails—ops and DBAs can sleep easy. Advanced monitoring aids troubleshooting and performance tuning. IaC automates large-scale cluster management. Ops can double as DBAs, and DBAs skip heavy lifting to focus on high-value tasks—or just enjoy a tea break while learning PG.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Who created Pigsty?">
        Pigsty is primarily developed by @Vonng / Ruohang Feng, a PostgreSQL veteran with a decade of open-source contributions and production experience at Alibaba, Tantan, and Apple. He's the founder of a one-person company (YC China/MiraclePlus S22) offering professional postgres consultancy. He's also a top database/cloud KOL with over 100k followers.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="What is Pigsty's ecosystem standing and impact?">
        Pigsty is one of the most active OSS projects in the PG ecosystem (OSSRank). It prevails in extension distribution and monitoring solutions, positioning itself as a challenger to cloud RDS. It's already in wide use across military, government, healthcare, internet, finance, and manufacturing sectors.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Which user scale is Pigsty suitable for?">
        Pigsty was built for massive PostgreSQL clusters, but it's also optimized for simplicity. Even solo developers or small businesses without DBA skills can get going easily. Largest known production scale: 25k vCPUs at 4.5 million QPS over six years. Smallest: a 1c1g VM demo or dev box.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Which capabilities does Pigsty offer?">
        Pigsty focuses on Postgres best practices and integrates well with complementary open-source tools like Etcd, Redis, MinIO, DuckDB, Prometheus, FerretDB, Babelfish, IvorySQL, PolarDB, OrioleDB, OpenHalo, Supabase, Greenplum, Dify, Odoo, and more.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Which scenarios does Pigsty fit?">
        Massive production postgres deployment, self-hosting RDS, object storage, caching, data warehousing, Supabase, etc. It can run enterprise apps like Odoo, Dify, wikis, GitLab, or serve as a monitoring hub for existing nodes and DBMS. It also excels at combining multiple PG extensions, powering interactive data apps, data visualization, and websites.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Is Pigsty open source and free?">
        Yes. Pigsty is 100% free software under the AGPLv3 license. You can use it freely for commercial purposes if you comply with that license. We value software freedom; for non-DBaaS/OEM use, we apply an Apache 2.0–like approach. See the license for details.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Does Pigsty offer commercial support?">
        Pigsty itself is free, but we provide commercial subscriptions for those who want assurance and expert support. Subscriptions extend coverage to more OS/PG/CPU architectures, plus consultancy. This delivers top-tier technical expertise and solutions, saving you time, reducing risk, and covering tough issues.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Can Pigsty be repackaged as multi-tenant DBaaS or rebranded?">
        Yes, under the AGPLv3 license—meaning any derivative work must be open-sourced. We reserve the right to pursue violations by public cloud/database vendors. If you prefer not to open-source derivatives, consider Pigsty Service Subscriptions, which provide explicit licensing and an AGPLv3 exemption for this scenario.
