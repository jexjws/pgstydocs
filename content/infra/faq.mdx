## Which components are included in INFRA

- Ansible for automation, deployment, and administration;
- Nginx for exposing any WebUI service and serving the YUM/APT repository;
- Self-Signed CA for SSL/TLS certificates;
- Prometheus for monitoring metrics
- Grafana for monitoring/visualization
- Loki for logging collection
- AlertManager for alerts aggregation
- Chronyd for NTP time synchronization on the admin node.
- DNSMasq for DNS registration and resolution.
- ETCD as DCS for PostgreSQL HA (dedicated module);
- PostgreSQL on meta nodes as CMDB (optional);
- Docker for stateless applications & tools (optional).

## How to restore Prometheus targets

If you accidentally deleted the Prometheus targets dir, you can register monitoring targets to Prometheus again with the:

```bash
./infra.yml -t register_prometheus  # register all infra targets to prometheus on infra nodes
./node.yml  -t register_prometheus  # register all node  targets to prometheus on infra nodes
./etcd.yml  -t register_prometheus  # register all etcd targets to prometheus on infra nodes
./minio.yml -t register_prometheus  # register all minio targets to prometheus on infra nodes
./pgsql.yml -t register_prometheus  # register all pgsql targets to prometheus on infra nodes
```

------

## How to restore Grafana datasource

PGSQL Databases in [`pg_databases`](/pgsql/param#pg_databases) are registered as Grafana datasource by default.

If you accidentally deleted the registered postgres datasource in Grafana, you can register them again with

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t register_grafana  # register all pgsql database (in pg_databases) as grafana datasource
```

------

## How to restore the HAProxy admin page proxy

The haproxy admin page is proxied by Nginx under the default server.

If you accidentally deleted the registered haproxy proxy settings in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/haproxy`, you can restore them again with

```bash
./node.yml -t register_nginx     # register all haproxy admin page proxy settings to nginx on infra nodes
```

------

## How to restore the DNS registration

PGSQL cluster/instance domain names are registered to `/etc/hosts.d/<name>` on infra nodes by default.

You can restore them with the following command:

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_dns   # register pg DNS names to dnsmasq on infra nodes
```

## How to expose a new Nginx upstream service

If you wish to expose a new WebUI service via the Nginx portal, you can add the service definition to the [`infra_portal`](/infra/param#infra_portal) parameter.

And re-run `./infra.yml -t nginx_config,nginx_launch` to update & apply the Nginx configuration.

If you wish to access with HTTPS, you must remove `files/pki/csr/pigsty.csr`, `files/pki/nginx/pigsty.{key,crt}` to force re-generating the Nginx SSL/TLS certificate to include the new upstream’s domain name.

## How to expose a web service through Nginx?

While you can directly access services via IP:Port, we still recommend consolidating access points by using domain names and uniformly accessing various web-based services through the Nginx portal. This approach helps centralize access, reduce the number of exposed ports, and facilitates access control and auditing.

If you wish to expose a new WebUI service through the Nginx portal, you can add the service definition to the [`infra_portal`](/infra/param#infra_portal) parameter. For example, here is the config used by the public demo site, which exposes several additional web services:

```yaml
infra_portal:
  home         : { domain: home.pigsty.io }
  grafana      : { domain: demo.pigsty.cc ,endpoint: "${admin_ip}:3000" ,websocket: true }
  prometheus   : { domain: p.pigsty.io ,endpoint: "${admin_ip}:9090" }
  alertmanager : { domain: a.pigsty.io ,endpoint: "${admin_ip}:9093" }
  blackbox     : { endpoint: "${admin_ip}:9115" }
  loki         : { endpoint: "${admin_ip}:3100" }
  # Additional web portals
  minio        : { domain: sss.pigsty  ,endpoint: "${admin_ip}:9001" ,scheme: https ,websocket: true }
  postgrest    : { domain: api.pigsty.io  ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:8884"   }
  pgadmin      : { domain: adm.pigsty.io  ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:8885"   }
  pgweb        : { domain: cli.pigsty.io  ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:8886"   }
  bytebase     : { domain: ddl.pigsty.io  ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:8887"   }
  gitea        : { domain: git.pigsty.io  ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:8889"   }
  wiki         : { domain: wiki.pigsty.io ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:9002"   }
  noco         : { domain: noco.pigsty.io ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:9003"   }
  supa         : { domain: supa.pigsty.io ,endpoint: "127.0.0.1:8000", websocket: true }
```

After completing the Nginx upstream service definition, use the following commands to register the new service with Nginx.

```bash
./infra.yml -t nginx_config           # regenerate Nginx config
./infra.yml -t nginx_launch           # update and apply nginx config

# you can reload nginx with ansible
ansible infra -b -a 'nginx -s reload'  # reload nginx with ansible
```

If you wish to access via HTTPS, you must delete `files/pki/csr/pigsty.csr` and `files/pki/nginx/pigsty.{key,crt}` to force the regeneration of the Nginx SSL/TLS certificate to include the new upstream domain names. If you prefer to use an SSL certificate issued by an authoritative organization instead of a certificate issued by Pigsty’s self-signed CA, you can place it in the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/cert/` directory and modify the corresponding configuration: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/<name>.conf`.

## How to manually add upstream repo files

Pigsty has a built-in wrapper script `bin/repo-add`, which will invoke Ansible playbook `node.yml` to add repository files to corresponding nodes.

```bash
bin/repo-add <selector> [modules]
bin/repo-add 10.10.10.10           # add node repos for node 10.10.10.10
bin/repo-add infra   node,infra    # add node and infra repos for group infra
bin/repo-add infra   node,local    # add node repos and local pigsty repo
bin/repo-add pg-test node,pgsql    # add node & pgsql repos for group pg-test
```
