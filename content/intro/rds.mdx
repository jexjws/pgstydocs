## What is RDS?

You can get started with raw PostgreSQL kernel easily like `systemctl start postgresql`, but it's far away from production grade service.
That's the main reason why people pay 160 $ / vCPUÂ·Month for a managed PostgreSQL service like AWS RDS. and even pay more for traditional "enterprise" database services.

The expertise of **Building and Managing Production-Grade PostgreSQL Service** is rare and expensive.


## What if...

But what if you can just build an enterprise-grade PostgreSQL service on your own, with a few commands, and no license fees?
Pigsty enables you to do that. It gives you HA PostgreSQL clusters with PITR, Monitoring & Alerting, Connection Pooling, along with

It's all starts from a few commands, and you can build a production-grade PostgreSQL service on your own,
without the need for expensive licenses or expertise.
