## Enable Backup

If you database cluster is created with [`pgbackrest_enable`](/pgsql/param/#pgbackrest_enable) set to `true`, the backup will be enabled automatically.

If it created with the `false` value, you can enable the pgbackrest component with:

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_backup    # run the pgbackrest subtask
```


--------

## Remove Backup

Pigsty will remove pgbackrest backup stanza when removing the primary instance ([`pg_role`](/pgsql/param/#pg_role) = `primary`).

```bash
./pgsql-rm.yml
./pgsql-rm.yml -e pg_rm_backup=false   # leave backup intact
./pgsql-rm.yml -t pg_backup            # only remove backup
```

Use the `pg_backup` subtask to remove the backup only, and use the [`keep_backup`](/pgsql/param/#keep_backup) arg to keep backups.

If your backup repo is **locked**, (e.g., S3 / MinIO has a lock option), this operation will fail.

<Callout title="Backup Removal" type="warn">

    Removing backup may lead to permanent data loss, it's a dangerous operation, do with extreme caution.

</Callout>


--------

## List Backup

This command will list all backups in the pgbackrest repository (shared by all clusters)

```bash
pgbackrest info
````


--------

## Manual Backup

Pigsty has a built-in script `/pg/bin/pg-backup` which wraps the `pgbackrest` backup command.

```bash
pg-backup        # take an incremental backup
pg-backup full   # take an full backup
pg-backup incr   # take an incremental backup
pg-backup diff   # take an differential backup
```



--------

## Base Backup

Pigsty has an alternative backup script `/pg/bin/pg-basebackup` which does not rely on `pgbackrest`, and gives you a physical copy of the database cluster.
The default backup dir is `/pg/backup`.

```bash tab="help"
NAME
  pg-basebackup  -- make base backup from PostgreSQL instance

SYNOPSIS
  pg-basebackup -sdfeukr
  pg-basebackup --src postgres:/// --dst . --file backup.tar.lz4

DESCRIPTION
-s, --src, --url     Backup source URL, optional, "postgres:///" by default, if password is required, it should be given in url, ENV or .pgpass
-d, --dst, --dir     Where to put backup files, "/pg/backup" by default
-f, --file           Overwrite default backup filename, "backup_${tag}_${date}.tar.lz4"
-r, --remove         .lz4 Files mtime before n minutes ago will be removed, default is 1200 (20hour)
-t, --tag            Backup file tag, if not set, target cluster_name or local ip address will be used. Also used as part of DEFAULT filename
-k, --key            Encryption key when --encrypt is specified, default key is ${tag}
-u, --upload         Upload backup files to cloud storage, (need your own implementation)
-e, --encryption     Encrypt with RC4 using OpenSSL, if not key is specified, tag is used as key
-h, --help           Print this message
```

Backup are compressed with `lz4`, You can unzip and extract the tarball with the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/data   # extract backup to this directory
cat /pg/backup/backup_pg-meta_20250713.tar.lz4 | unlz4 -d -c | tar -xC /tmp/data
```


--------

## Logical Backup

You can also use the `pg_dump` command to perform a logical backup.

Logical backups cannot be used for PITR (Point In Time Recovery),
but they are useful for migrating data between different major versions, or implement flexible data export logic.



--------

## Bootstrap from Repo

Now let's say you have an existing cluster `pg-meta`, and want to **FORK** it as `pg-meta2`:

You'll need to create the new `pg-meta2` cluster fork, then run `pitr` on it.
