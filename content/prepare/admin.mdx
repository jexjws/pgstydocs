## User

Pigsty requires an OS **user** with passwordless [`ssh`](#ssh) and [`sudo`](#sudo-privileges) on all managed nodes.


------

### Naming Convention

Usually we'll choose a name such as `dba` or `admin` for this purpose,
but avoid using `root` or `postgres`:

<Callout title="Avoid using root user" type="warn">

    While possible, using `root` as admin user is not recommended for security reasons.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Don't use postgres dbsu as admin user" type="error">

    DBSU (`postgres` by default)  should **NOT** be used as admin user.
    It will cause unexpected security issues.

    If you are using a different dbsu user, avoid using it as admin user as well.

</Callout>


------

### Provide Password

The nopass requirement is optional if you can accept the password prompt for every `ssh` and `sudo` command.

<Callout title="Run playbook with password prompt" type="info">

    You can use the `-k|--ask-pass` when running [playbook](/admin/playbook) to prompt for the **ssh** password.

    And use `-K|--ask-become-pass` to prompt for the **sudo** password.

    ```bash
    ./install.yml -k -K
    ```
</Callout>


------

### Create Admin User

It's user/vendor's responsibility to create & deliver such an admin user during server provisioning stage.
But if you don't have such an admin user, or that user is restricted, you can create one with pigsty itself:

<Callout title="Create admin user with pigsty" type="info">

    Assuming you have a root or existing admin user on the node, you can create an admin user with pigsty itself.

    ```bash
    ./node.yml -k -K -t node_admin -e ansible_user=[existing_admin_user]
    ```

    It will leverage the existing admin to create a new admin user.
    It will create a dedicated `dba` (uid=88) user described by the following parameters,
    with sudo / ssh properly configured.

    | Name | Description | Default |
    |------|-------------|---------|
    | [`node_admin_enabled`](/node/param#node_admin_enabled) | enable node admin user | `true` |
    | [`node_admin_uid`](/node/param#node_admin_uid) | uid of node admin user | `88` |
    | [`node_admin_username`](/node/param#node_admin_username) | name of node admin user | `dba` |


</Callout>


------

### Sudo Privileges

All the [admin user](#user) should have passwordless `sudo` privileges on all managed nodes.

In case you want to configure an admin user with passwordless `sudo` privileges from scratch:

<Callout title="Allow sudo without password" type="info">

    To manually allow a user to execute `sudo` commands without password:

    Create a sudoers file for your admin user (assume `vagrant`, replace with your name choice):

    ```bash
    echo '%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant
    ```

    Assume your admin user name choice is `dba`, then `/etc/sudoers.d/dba` content would be

    ```bash
    %dba ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ```

</Callout>

Ansible relies on `sudo` to execute commands with root privileges on managed nodes.
So on environments where `sudo` is not available (like inside a slim container), you may have to install `sudo` first.





------

## SSH

Your current user should have nopass ssh access to all managed nodes as corresponding admin user.

Your current user can be the admin user itself, but not required as long as you can ssh as the admin user.

SSH configuration is Linux 101, but we will cover the basics here in case you are not familiar with it:


------

### Generate SSH Key

Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one

<Callout title="Generate SSH Key" type="info">

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -q
    ```

    Pigsty will do that for you if you don't have a key pair, during the [`bootstrap`](/install/offline#bootstrap) stage.

</Callout>

------

### Copy SSH Key

You'll need to distribute your generated public key remote (and local) servers, and put
it into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the admin user on all nodes.
The `ssh-copy-id` util can be used.


<Callout title="Distribute your ssh key to other nodes" type="info">

    Copy the public key to all managed nodes, `ssh-copy-id` or add to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` manually.

```bash
ssh-copy-id <ip>                        # Interactive password entry
```

    You can use `sshpass` tool to pass the password directly without prompting, but it's dangerous:

```bash
sshpass -p <password> ssh-copy-id <ip>  # Non-interactive (use with caution)
```

</Callout>


------

### Using Alias

When direct ssh access is not available (due to jumpserver, other port, credentials, etc...), consider:

<Callout title="Using SSH aliases" type="info">

    Configure SSH aliases in `~/.ssh/config`, and put custom parameters for the alias there.

    ```bash
    Host meta
        HostName 10.10.10.10
        User dba                      # <--- not the same user on remote
        IdentityFile /etc/dba/id_rsa  # <--- not the ordinary key
        Port 24                       # <--- not the well-known port
    ```

    And reference the alias in the inventory, use `ansible_host` to specify the real ssh alias.

    ```yaml
    nodes:
      hosts:          # if node `10.10.10.10` requires an SSH alias `meta`
        10.10.10.10: { ansible_host: meta }  # <---- access via `ssh meta`
    ```

    SSH parameters can be used directly in ansible, Check [Ansible Inventory Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#connecting-to-hosts-behavioral-inventory-parameters) for details.

</Callout>


------

### Check Accessibility

Your should be able to access all managed nodes with nopass `ssh` via your current user from admin node.
And the remote user (admin user) should have the privilege to run nopass `sudo` commands.

<Callout title="Verify nopass ssh sudo is working" type="info">

    Run this command on admin node to all managed nodes:

    ```bash
    ssh <ip|alias> 'sudo ls'
    ```

    if there's no password prompt or error raised, nopass ssh/sudo is working as expected.

</Callout>
