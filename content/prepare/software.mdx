## Linux

Pigsty runs on <span className="text-xl text-amber-500 font-black">Linux</span> Operating System, it supports **10** mainstream Linux distros: [**Compatible OS List**](/prepare/linux)

We recommend using **RockyLinux 9.6**, **Debian 12.11**, or **Ubuntu 24.04.5** as the default OS options.

<Callout title="Run pigsty on macOS?" type={"info"}>

    You can install pigsty on macOS, and initiate control from your local laptop with `ansible`. (use as admin node)
    But the database / infra / node / etcd services are still running on Linux nodes.

</Callout>

We **strongly recommend** using a clean installed OS environment with `en_US` set as the primary language.

<Callout title="How to enable en_US locale?" type={"info"}>

    To ensure the `en_US` locale is available when using other primary language:

    ```bash
    localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8
    localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    ```

</Callout>


Pigsty **DOES NOT** use containers, main components are packed for specific distro major version.

<Callout title="Use the same OS version on all nodes" type={"warn"}>

    Please use the same major and minor version of the OS on all nodes in a single deployment.

</Callout>


--------

## File System

Pigsty suggests using `ext4` or `xfs` file systems, both of which have the best performance for PostgreSQL use cases.
If you know what you are doing, you can also consider using file systems like `zfs`, but never run database services on network file systems like `nfs`.

If you need to use MinIO, it is recommended to use the `xfs` file system, which is the only file system recommended by MinIO.
It performs better in scenarios with a large number of small files, but the tool ecosystem (e.g., data recovery) is slightly inferior to `ext4`.

The default recommendation for running standard PostgreSQL services is to use the Linux `ext4` file system.


--------

## Firewall

Your security policy and firewall setup should allow access to the required ports.

To access the WebUI services, you'll have to allow the HTTP (`80`) / HTTPS (`443`) access.

To access the PostgreSQL database services, you'll have to allow the `5432` port for postgres.

<Callout title="You may access postgres services via other ports" type={"warn"}>

    - `5432`: PostgreSQL database
    - `6432`: Pgbouncer Connection Pooler
    - `5433`: PG Primary Service
    - `5434`: PG Replica Service
    - `5436`: PG Default Service
    - `5438`: PG Offline Service

    If you are accessing the postgres services via other ports, allow them accordingly

</Callout>


In a typical public cloud VPS setup, port `22/80/443/5432` are usually opened.

<Callout title="Expose database ports with caution" type={"warn"}>

    Exposing database service ports directly to the Internet is very dangerous.
    If you need to do this, consider consulting [Security Best Practices](/config/security/) and proceed with caution.

</Callout>

In a typical production setup, port `22/80/443` are opened to DBA/OPS from LAN / Jumpserver.
And other ports are accessed from intranet. You have to make sure they are opened internally: [used ports](/node/arch).




--------

## Ansible

Pigsty uses [**Ansible**](/admin/ansible) to initiate control from admin node to all managed nodes.

You don't need to care about details, ansible is installed during the [**Bootstrap**](/install/offline#bootstrap) stage.

<Callout title="Install Ansible Manually" type="info">

    ```bash tab="Debian / Ubuntu"
    sudo apt install -y ansible python3-jmespath
    ```
    ```bash tab="EL 9"
    sudo dnf install -y ansible python3-jmespath
    ```
    ```bash tab="EL 8"
    sudo dnf install -y ansible python3.12-jmespath
    ```
    ```bash tab="EL 7"
    sudo yum install -y ansible python-jmespath
    ```
    ```bash tab="macOS"
    brew install ansible
    pip3 install jmespath
    ```

</Callout>

Ansible is only required on admin node, you can run ansible on macOS to use your laptop as admin node.

## Pigsty

(<span className="text-sky-500 font-black">RECOMMENDED</span>) You can get & extract the latest stable version of pigsty source with:

```bash tab="Default"
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/get | bash; cd ~/pigsty
```
```bash tab="Mirror"
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.cc/get | bash; cd ~/pigsty   # china mirror
```

To install a specific version, pass the version string as the first parameter:

```bash tab="Default"
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/get | bash -s v3.6.0; cd ~/pigsty
```
```bash tab="Mirror"
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.cc/get | bash -s v3.6.0; cd ~/pigsty # china mirror
```

You can also use `git` to clone the Pigsty source repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty):

```bash title="clone the latest"
git clone https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty.git; cd ~/pigsty
```

<Callout title="Checkout a specific version before using" type="warn">

    The default `main` branch may in an unstable development status, `git checkout v3.6.0` before using.

</Callout>

```bash
$ curl -fssL https://repo.pigsty.cc/get | bash -s v3.6.0
[v3.6.0] ===========================================
$ curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.cc/get | bash

[Download] ===========================================
[ OK ] version = v3.6.0 (from arg)
curl -fSL https://repo.pigsty.cc/src/pigsty-v3.6.0.tgz -o /tmp/pigsty-v3.6.0.tgz
[WARN] tarball = /tmp/pigsty-v3.6.0.tgz exists, size = 1472486, use it

[Install] ===========================================
[ OK ] install = /home/vagrant/pigsty, from /tmp/pigsty-v3.6.0.tgz
[Bootstrap] ===========================================
[ OK ] ansible = ready
[ OK ] bootstrap = skip
you can run ./bootstrap to extrac offline package and install ansible
[TodoList] ===========================================
cd /home/vagrant/pigsty
./configure      # [OPTIONAL] preflight-check and config generation
./install.yml    # deployment everything described by your config
```

You can also download the pigsty src (`pigsty-<version>.tar.gz`) from [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/releases/latest) manually:

```bash tab="Default"
wget https://repo.pigsty.io/src/pigsty-v3.6.0.tgz
```
```bash tab="Mirror"
wget https://pigsty.cc/pgsty/pigsty/releases/download/v3.6.0/pigsty-v3.6.0.tgz
```
```bash tab="GitHub"
wget https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/releases/download/v3.6.0/pigsty-v3.6.0.tgz
```



If your environment does not have Internet access, consider downloading offline packages along with source tarball and upload them to your nodes.

Check [Offline Installation](/install/offline) for details.
