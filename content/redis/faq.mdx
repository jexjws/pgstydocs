## ABORT due to existing redis instance

> use `redis_clean = true` and `redis_safeguard = false` to force clean redis data

This happens when you run `redis.yml` to init a redis instance that is already running, and [`redis_clean`](/redis/param#redis_clean) is set to `false`.

If `redis_clean` is set to `true` (and the `redis_safeguard` is set to `false`, too), the `redis.yml` playbook will remove the existing redis instance and re-init it as a new one, which makes the `redis.yml` playbook fully idempotent.

## ABORT due to redis_safeguard enabled

> This happens when removing a redis instance with [`redis_safeguard`](/redis/param#redis_safeguard) set to `true`.

You can disable [`redis_safeguard`](/redis/param#redis_safeguard) to remove the Redis instance. This is what redis_safeguard is for.
