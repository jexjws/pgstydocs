You can get the latest beta version of Pigsty with:

```bash tab="Default"
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/beta | bash; cd ~/pigsty
```
```bash tab="Mirror"
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.cc/beta | bash; cd ~/pigsty   # china mirror
```

But there's no active Pigsty beta version available now.

Since the [latest](/release/latest) stable version is just released: [v3.6.0](/release/note#v360)
